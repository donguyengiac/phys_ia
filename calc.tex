By calculating the value of g from the gradient and comparing it to the accepted literature value of g, we can determine the experimental error and use it to evaluate the accuracy of the experiment. \\
Gradient of the line of best fit is 0.0002028. Maximum gradient is 0.0002106 and minimum is 0.0001498. \\
Gradient = 2mgk \\
with m: mass of marble: 0.0065kg, and k: spring constant of the spring being used: 600N/m \\
â†’ g best fit = 0.0002028 * 600 / (2 * 0.0065) = 9.36 ms-2
g max = 0.0002106 * 600 / (2 * 0.0065) = 9.72 ms-2
g min = 0.0001498 * 600 / (2 * 0.0065) = 6.91 ms-2
range = (9.72 - 6.91) / 2 = 1.41
so we get the value of g is g = 9.361.04 ms-2
comparing this with accepted literature value of g = 9.81 ms-2 (International Baccalaureate Organization, 2016)
percentage experimental error = (9.81 - 9.36) / 9.81 * 100% = 4.59%
