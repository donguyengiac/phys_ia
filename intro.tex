The inspiration for this experiment came from a childhood game with my brother. We used to play a game where we drop a marble down a ramp with a spring at the bottom, and when the marble hits the spring it will bounce back up the ramp, and whoeverâ€™s marble reaches the highest point wins. I have always been fascinated by this, and now I want to actually see how much the spring is compressed when the marble is dropped onto it and observe its behavior. This can then be applied to making marble machines, marble tracks, etc. when you need to determine a spring's compression to activate a latch or a different mechanism.
