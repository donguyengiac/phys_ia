\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clamp 1 head of track to retort stand (Pic 3) and weigh down the other end (Pic 4) to make a ramp for the marble
    \item Use meter rule to measure height from table of different points and make markings (40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 cm)
    \item Attach spring to wood block so that the spring lies on the track
    \item Set up meter rule right behind the track to measure the compression
    \item Set up high speed camera focusing on spring
    \item Record drop of marble from 40cm mark on ramp
    \item Repeat step 6 five more times to reduce random error
    \item Repeat steps 7 \& 8 eight more times from different markings (35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 cm)
    \item Analyse the high speed footage frame by frame to determine and record the maximum spring compression for each drop.
