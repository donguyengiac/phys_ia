\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clamp 1 head of track to retort standand weigh down the other end to make a ramp for the marble as shown in Fig. \ref{fig2}. The curvature or path and shape of the ramp doesn't matter as long as there is a horizontal segment at the end, because we just need to control the drop height.
    \item Use meter rule to measure height from table of different points and make markings (40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 cm). The uncertainty of these markings will be 1mm as this is the uncertainty of the meter rule.
    \item Using Blu-tack, attach the spring to the wood block so that the spring lies on the track
    \item Set up meter rule behind the track and the spring to measure the compression
    \item Set up high speed camera in line with and focusing on the spring end 
    \item Record drop of marble from 40cm mark on ramp
    \item Repeat step 6 five more times to reduce random error
    \item Repeat steps 7 \& 8 eight more times from different markings (35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 cm)
    \item Analyse the high speed footage frame by frame to determine and record the maximum spring compression for each drop.
