The uncertainty of the compression is Â±0.001m (1mm) because the smallest scale division of the meter rule is 1mm and this takes into account a few blurry frames. The uncertainty of the drop height is 0.001m (1mm) to take into account the thickness of the markings on the ramp and small inconsistencies between drop heights on the ramp.
