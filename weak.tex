        Weakness & Significance & Improvement \\ 
        \hline
        Use of high speed camera & Low significance, however the equipment can be expensive and difficult to obtain & Find alternative ways to measure maximum spring compression \\ 
        \hline
        Visual analysis of maximum point through high speed camera footage & High significance, the limited frame rate of the camera means on some trials the moving spring end gets blurry and makes it difficult to determine the maximum compression. & Use high speed camera with higher frame rate \\
        \hline
        Friction of marble on ramp & Low significance, heat dissipated from friction of the marble on the ramp is not considered in the conservation of energy equation but the ramp and the marble are both relatively smooth so this is not a significant component & Lubricate the ramp \\
        \hline
        This is not a problem in my experiment, but a possible problem that might arise is when using weak springs, the force from the marble might cause deformation of the spring and change spring constant & High significance, this will cause the data points for higher drops to be unreliable and no longer linear & Choose spring with sufficient constant. In this case my spring has spring constant of 600N/m, which I believe is enough for my experiment \\
