\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 marble diameter 1.5 cm.
    \item 2 retort stand \& clamps.
    \item 1 spring with known spring constant from manufacturer's specifications.
    \item 1 long flexible track (around 70-100cm). I use 2 Hot Wheels\textregistered~tracks attached together.
    \item 1 high speed camera (minimum 240 fps). I use an iPhone 11's Camera app for this.
    \item 1 block of wood heavy enough to hold down the end of the track.
    \item 1 meter rule with up to 1mm division.
    \item some Blu-Tack to hold the spring in place.
